captions_and_labels.csv,file_id,"Primary key for each row. Each row contains one image, with its caption and corresponding chunks and labels."
captions_and_labels.csv,file,"Name of the image file. The file is in the folder images, in the subfolder that starts with the first six characters of the file name (i.g. the path to that file is f""{file[:4]}/{file[:6]}/{file}""). For example, the path to the image ""PMC10000323_jbsr-107-1-3012-g3_undivided_1_1.jpg"" is ""PMC1/PMC100/PMC10000323_jbsr-107-1-3012-g3_undivided_1_1.jpg"". The last part of the name before .jpg refer to the reference present in the caption, the sub-image order and the total amount of sub-images in a given image. For example, if the file corresponds to figure b (according to the caption) out of 4 sub-images present in an article image, the last part of the file name will be ""b_2_4.jgp""."
captions_and_labels.csv,main_image,"Id from the original image (it corresponds to image_id from case_images.parquet). Files that were created as splits from an image file in a given article will have different file_id and file, and the same main_image value."

captions_and_labels.csv,caption,"It is the caption that corresponds to the image. If the image is a part of the original image present in the article, this field includes the corresponding part of the whole caption. In cases where the caption was split, there may be some extra special characters or truncated sentences, but this in no case affects the labels that are assigned to each image."
